**Mengchao Guo（郭孟超）** is a researcher focused on multimodal embodied intelligence, knowledge-graph-assisted manipulation, and cognitively inspired human–machine interaction. His work spans VLA models, spatial knowledge graphs, robotic manipulation, sequential health knowledge graphs, and multimodal physiological-signal fusion. He aims to build generalizable, explainable, and knowledge-augmented intelligent systems capable of long-horizon reasoning and real-world task execution.

He is currently conducting research on *KG-assisted precise robotic manipulation* based on VLA-Adapter + LIBERO-Spatial, focusing on adaptive KG modulation, spatial reasoning, and fine-grained grasping decision systems. His broader research includes *Dual-Stream Transformer for cross-modal physiological signal fusion* and *patient-specific temporal knowledge graphs (PT-TKG)* for personalized healthcare analytics.

Before this, he worked on multimodal sensing systems, clinical knowledge graph construction, and embodied planning frameworks for long-horizon tasks. He has published papers in AI, medical informatics, and robotics, and actively contributes to open-source embodied intelligence toolchains.
